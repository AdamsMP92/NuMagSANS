NuMagSANS Documentation
=======================

Overview
--------

NuMagSANS is a GPU-accelerated computational engine for the simulation
and analysis of nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS).

The framework enables atomistic and micromagnetic SANS calculations,
including polarization-resolved channels, correlation functions,
and spectral decomposition.

NuMagSANS is designed as a deterministic single-run computational engine
with a clear execution pipeline and reproducible output.


Key Features
------------

- GPU-accelerated atomistic SANS computation
- Full polarization analysis (spin-flip, non-spin-flip, chiral terms)
- 2D and 1D scattering cross sections
- Correlation functions and pair distribution functions
- Spectral decomposition of scattering amplitudes
- Python facade for simplified workflow integration
