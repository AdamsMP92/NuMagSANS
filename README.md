## About

**NuMagSANS** is a **GPU-accelerated software package** designed for the computation of **nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)** cross sections and correlation functions.  
The program allows users to import **spatially resolved nuclear-density** and **magnetization data**, offering exceptional flexibility for the analysis of **complex and anisotropic magnetic materials**.

The software provides **full rotational control** of the sample orientation, enabling comprehensive studies of **angular-dependent scattering features**.  
NuMagSANS further includes a **versatile library of more than 70 response functions**, covering:

- Two-dimensional SANS cross sections  
- Correlation functions  
- Azimuthally averaged quantities  

These capabilities allow users to obtain detailed insights into the **structural and magnetic characteristics** of their systems.  
By leveraging **GPU acceleration**, NuMagSANS achieves **high computational performance and scalability**, making it a **powerful and efficient tool for advanced SANS simulations and data analysis**.
