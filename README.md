## üß† About

**NuMagSANS** is a **GPU-accelerated software package** designed for the computation of **nuclear and magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)** cross sections and correlation functions.  
The program allows users to import discrete datasets representing the **position-dependent nuclear scattering length density** and **magnetization** in real space, providing exceptional flexibility for the analysis of **complex and anisotropic magnetic materials**.

**NuMagSANS** supports simulations across multiple length scales:  
- **Atomistic systems**, featuring complex crystal lattices ‚Äî e.g., data generated from atomistic spin-dynamics simulations with [*Vampire 7*](https://vampire.york.ac.uk/) or [*UppASD*](https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD.git).  
- **Mesoscopic systems**, such as micromagnetic models ‚Äî e.g., data generated from micromagnetic simulations with [*MuMax3*](https://mumax.github.io/) or [*OOMMF*](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/).  

The software offers **full rotational control** of the sample orientation, enabling comprehensive studies of **angular-dependent scattering features**.  
It includes a **versatile library of more than 70 response functions**, covering:

- 2D SANS cross sections (unpolarized, SANSPOL, POLARIS)
- 1D SANS cross sections (azimuthal average)
- 1D correlation functions
- 1D pair-distance distribution functions
- 2D correlation functions

These capabilities provide detailed insights into the **structural and magnetic characteristics** of complex systems.  
Leveraging **GPU acceleration**, *NuMagSANS* achieves **high computational performance and scalability**, making it a **powerful and efficient tool for advanced SANS simulations and data analysis**.
